          <span class="u-text-custom-color-1" style="font-size: 1.125rem;">y project is something through research I discovered has already been done but not in the full <br>capacity of which I want to do it. <br>I am thinking of a mobile application of a compendium of board games from all over the world with <br>a catch. <br>The original application will  be free but only have a limited number of common games (maybe 3) <br>but with the ability to purch​ase more games through microtransactions.  $1.99 each etc. <br>I chose this route because my primary aim for this course is to develop skills to make money. <br>Therefore I will be putting in micro transactions.  It’s all about profit for me. <br>There are gaming compendium apps however none of them have microtransactions to download <br>more games and that I believe is something missing in this genre. <br>This project will involved extensive research into the rules and regulations of all known and <br>unknown games. <br>Detailed artwork down to the letter of the boards, pieces, mascots etc. <br>It will also involve licencing fees and negotiations from the boardgame manufacturers in order to be <br>able to use their mascots and original names of the games. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Description</span>: <br>A compendium of well known board games from all over the world with multiplay ability depending <br>on max amount of players ex: monopoly. <br>People will be able to download the gaming app which will initially come with around 3 well known <br>games and they will have the ability to purchase more games and also possibly collectible items and <br>level up bonuses depending on the game. <br>These games could include child friendly games  like “Snakes and Ladders” as well as more mature <br>games like “Roulette, Poker and BlackJack” <br>There will be childproof settings which will prevent kids from accessing the more mature content as <br>well as payment security via paypal which will be behind a secure server and 2nd degree <br>authentication. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Tools:</span>&nbsp;<br>Tools to create this app will include but not limited to Adobe Photoshop and other imaging software, <br>I have done work on Adobe Photoshop before in creating 3d images ad well as animations however I <br>would most likely employ a digital graphics engineer as my knowledge is very limited. <br>Programming languages such as Kotlin, C++, C#, python to name a few will be used in order to be <br>able to complete more complex graphics and algorithms. <br>Reference: harikian78 @harkiran78 <br>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-programming-languages-for-android-app-development/ <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Outcome:</span>
            <br>If this project was able to be developed eventually I believe it will have a positive reception <br>worldwide due to the demand for online boardgames. <br>Everything is going digital now and the ability to play any games you want in one application will <br>reduce the need for multiple apps on the one phone. <br>There will be people who will be happy to stick with the free version of the app and deal with the <br>advertisements as well however I believe a large percentage would download 1 or 2 extra games.&nbsp;
